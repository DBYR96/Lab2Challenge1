        <p>I began univeristy in September of 2022 as part of the Gradute apprenticeship programme through my work at Cala Homes.
            I started in 2nd year of the cyber security degree and have found the work load challenging. While working 9 - 5:30 and sometimes
            later, it's not always easy to come home after a long day and start working again but with cyber security being something I am interested in
            and want to persue, I am sure they work will pay off. I hope to use the knowledge I gain through the different modules to benefit me in my job.
